        <h1>History of London</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          A Brief History of London London was founded by the Romans around AD
          43 and was originally called Londinium. It quickly grew into an
          important trading port. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city
          declined but was later revived by the Anglo-Saxons. In 1066, William
          the Conqueror invaded England, and London became the political center
          of the country.

          The Tower of London was built shortly after to secure his control.
          During the medieval period, London grew in population and importance.
          The city suffered greatly during the Black Death in the 14th century,
          and later during the Great Fire of London in 1666, which destroyed
          much of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 18th and 19th centuries, during the British Empireâ€™s peak,
          London became the world's largest city and a center of global power,
          finance, and culture. The 20th century brought challenges such as
          World War II, during which the city was heavily bombed in the Blitz.
          After the war, London rebuilt and transformed into the diverse, modern
          metropolis it is today.
